    "# Training a Machine Learning Model\n",
    "Training machine learning models to predict FPL player points using engineered features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models to train\n",
    "- Random Forest, ensemble of decision trees \n",
    "- Linear Regression, baseline for comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- rolling_avg_points, player form last 5 games \n",
    "- opponent_difficulty, fixture difficulty (1 -10 scale)\n",
    "- minutes, playing time a player gets (0-90 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "- Load features from 'fpl_features.csv',split the data into two parts 80% training and 20% testing, then test both models on the training data, assess on the test data & compare the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Metrics \n",
    "- MAE (Mean Absolute Error), How far the predictions were off by \n",
    "- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), Prediction errors\n",
    "- R^2 Score, How well the model predicts (0-1, higher score is better)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "Random Forest normally achieves - \n",
    "MAE, 2.0-2.5 points\n",
